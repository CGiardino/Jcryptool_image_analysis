Jcryptool_image_analysis
========================

Jcryptool with enhanced functionalities for image analysis

You can use this file for a fast start with JCrypTool, e.g. by
encrypting or digitally signing it using the 'Algorithms' menu,
or by applying one of the analysis offered in the
'Analysis' menu.

All cryptographic for image analysis operations are additionally arranged  in the Analysis menu tab. A double click on the
selected entry on the 'Algorithms' tab launches a wizard which
guides you step by step through the encryption process.
Decrypting the file at a later time works the same way.

All offered algorithms as well as all analysis always
require an opened file in one of the JCrypTool editors.

More information on learning, using and extending JCrypTool is
available in the extensive online help, which can be accessed
via the menu 'Help'.
